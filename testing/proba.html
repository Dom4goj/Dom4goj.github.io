              intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences. With a strong foundation in graphic design, which I
              began studying in 2015 at the School of Applied Arts and Design Osijek, and my graduation in 2019 as one of
              the top graduates, I have honed my skills and expanded my expertise to include User Experience and User
              Interface design. My journey led me to successfully completing a specialized UX/UI designer course in July
              2023. My goal is to merge my artistic sensibilities with user-centric design principles to create impactful
              solutions.</li>

          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            My work experience helped me develop a strong foundation in design principles and tools. Collaborating
            within teams and effectively communicating with clients to bring their visions to life became second nature.
            Recognizing the evolving landscape of design, I embarked on a journey to expand my skills into the realm of
            UX/UI design.<br><br>
            My pursuit of enhancing my capabilities led me to undertake a UX/UI designer course in 2023. I further
            expanded my
            skill set to encompass user-centered design principles and digital interactivity:<br><br>
            - Proficiency in wireframing and prototyping tools such as Adobe XD and Figma<br>
            - Deep understanding of user psychology and behavior, enabling me to create designs that resonate with
            target audiences<br>
            - UX Research: Delving into user psychology and behavior, I am equipped to infuse my designs with empathy
            and an innate understanding of user needs.<br>
            - Storyboarding and User Journeys: I honed my ability to visualize user interactions and experiences,
            facilitating the creation of designs that resonate deeply.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            <strong>Beyond design paradigms, my technical skills include:</strong><br><br>
            - Responsive Design: Ensuring seamless experiences across diverse devices through responsive design
            principles.<br>
            - Front-End Development: I delved into online courses including HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript courses,
            crafting a personal website using Bootstrap. Recently, I am delving into Angular for a personal project.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            Collaboration fuels my creativity, and I am excited about the prospect of joining a team of fellow designers
            and developers. I have a unique ability to identify user experience opportunities in everyday life, and I
            relish brainstorming sessions with friends to solve common pain points of products we use daily.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            <strong>Projects:</strong><br><br>
            - Ferivi Webshop Enhancement:<br>
            Collaborated with the Ferivi team to edit webshop images and design eye-catching flyers, contributing to a
            more engaging online shopping experience for customers. This project taught me the importance of aligning
            visuals with user needs to drive conversion rates.
            <br><br>
            - Čazma Natura Information Tables:<br>
            Helped design information tables for Čazma Natura, creating clear and accessible communication of vital
            information. This project highlighted the significance of information hierarchy and the role of design in
            enhancing communication.
            <br><br>

            Contributed to the Croatian Lottery campaign, producing visually striking graphics that captured the essence
            of the promotion. This experience reinforced my ability to adapt designs to fit specific brand identities
            and campaign goals.
