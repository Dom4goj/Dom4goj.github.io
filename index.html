                <p class="my-2">Hello! I am Domagoj Hajduković, a junior UI/UX designer who is passionate about creating unique and intuitive digital experiences. Although I am relatively new to this field, my knowledge, creativity and desire to learn never stop.</p>
                <p class="my-2">Throughout my career, I have gained basic Design experience working professionally as a graphic designer for 2 years and recently completing a UI/UX Design course at the Algebra University College. These challenges allowed me to encounter different aspects of UI/UX design and feel the joy that comes from creating visually appealing and functional solutions that make life easier for users.</p>
                <p class="my-2">Through continuous training and research of new trends, technologies and tools in this field, I want to upgrade my skills in order to provide the best possible results to my clients.</p>

                    <div class="display-6">WhatsApp Redesign</div>
                </h1>
                <p class="my-2">I often use the WhatsApp application for catching up with my friends and family. While using it, I started thinking about the UX of the application and realised there are some errors that are contradictory to modern UX rules.</p>
                <p class="my-2">So I decided to redesign the elements that are wrong according to my UX knowledge. The navigation bar is on the top of the screen, so I put it at the bottom for users to easily navigate the application</p>
                <p class="my-2">All the font sizes were too small for users that are older or have bad vision. So I made it bigger for better readability. I changed some gray icons and text into light green that matches the WhatsApp brand.</p>
                <p class="my-2">I repositioned the timestamps to the middle of the screen in the text bubbles so users can have an easier time recognizing which messages are theirs and which are the other people. I changed some input fields into to the usual input boxes because at first I didn’t realise they were input fields in the usual application.</p>

                <h1>
                    <div class="display-6">Landing page</div>
                </h1>
                <p class="my-2">For practice I designed a landing page for an imaginary company that sells and delivers Neon signs. While considering user's needs and thoughts, I made a landing page with the focus on the user.</p>
                <p class="my-2">The most important thing to the user is ordering the product, so the CTA with the label “Order now” is in the middle of the screen, emphasized with the red color that contrasts with the black around it.</p>
                <p class="my-2">Next to the CTA is the header that tells the user what they are ordering and that the delivery is free so that the user instantly thinks “Hey, that's nice”. Users that have positive emotions during the contact with the company are more likely to buy the product.</p>
                <p class="my-2">The focus of the website are personalised neon signs, so on the rest of the landing page is information about high quality materials and the process of making the signs. Users that know more about the product are more likely to buy it as well.</p>

                <h1>
                    <div class="display-6">Payment process</div>
                </h1>
                <p class="my-2">I designed an application for a company that delivers craft beer to buyers as a project for my UX/UI Designer course. Here is a payment process from that project.</p>
                <p class="my-2">On the top bar is a label that tells the user where they currently are in the application. Users will always easily remember which application they are using right now, so there is no need for a logo on the top of every screen. Users prefer to know at which step in the ordering process they are currently at.</p>
                <p class="my-2">While on the Cart screen, the user can still change their order. Some users might add more products to the cart that way.</p>
                <p class="my-2">It is important to show the users the total amount of their payment, including tax and delivery costs. Adding the tax and delivery costs to the total in the later steps of the payment process makes the user think you want to trick them. Users buy more products from companies that they can trust.</p>
                <p class="my-2">It is important for the input forms to be properly grouped in categories like personal information, user location, card information,... Grouping elements makes it easier for users to process the information.</p>
