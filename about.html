            I am Domagoj Hajduković. <br><br>As a dedicated and creative UX/UI designer, I am passionate about crafting
            intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences. With a strong foundation in graphic design, which I
            began studying in 2015 at the School of Applied Arts and Design Osijek, and my graduation in 2019 as one of
            the top graduates, I have honed my skills and expanded my expertise to include User Experience and User
            Interface design. My journey led me to successfully completing a specialized UX/UI designer course in July
            2023. My goal is to merge my artistic sensibilities with user-centric design principles to create impactful
            solutions.

            <strong>Work and Skills:</strong><br><br>
            Upon completing my studies in 2019, I immediately embarked on a career as a graphic designer at
            Print-studio, where I further developed my skill set:
            <br><br>
            - Proficient in CorelDRAW, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign<br>
            - Exceptional eye for detail and composition, refining designs for both print and digital platforms<br>
            - Collaborative mindset, working effectively in a team to achieve project goals and meet tight deadlines<br>
            - Effective communication skills, ensuring client satisfaction by understanding and translating their
            vision<br>
            - Print-Ready Design: Mastery of print-ready design ensures that my creations translate seamlessly from the
            digital realm to tangible media, maintaining visual integrity.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            My work experience helped me develop a strong foundation in design principles and tools. Collaborating
            within teams and effectively communicating with clients to bring their visions to life became second nature.
            Recognizing the evolving landscape of design, I embarked on a journey to expand my skills into the realm of
            UX/UI design.<br><br>
            My pursuit of enhancing my capabilities led me to undertake a UX/UI designer course in 2023. I further
            expanded my
            skill set to encompass user-centered design principles and digital interactivity:<br><br>
            - Proficiency in wireframing and prototyping tools such as Adobe XD and Figma<br>
            - Deep understanding of user psychology and behavior, enabling me to create designs that resonate with
            target audiences<br>
            - UX Research: Delving into user psychology and behavior, I am equipped to infuse my designs with empathy
            and an innate understanding of user needs.<br>
            - Storyboarding and User Journeys: I honed my ability to visualize user interactions and experiences,
            facilitating the creation of designs that resonate deeply.

          <p class="my-4">
            <strong>Beyond design paradigms, my technical skills include:</strong><br><br>
            - Responsive Design: Ensuring seamless experiences across diverse devices through responsive design
            principles.<br>
            - Front-End Development: I delved into online courses including HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript courses,
            crafting a personal website using Bootstrap. Recently, I am delving into Angular for a personal project.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            Collaboration fuels my creativity, and I am excited about the prospect of joining a team of fellow designers
            and developers. I have a unique ability to identify user experience opportunities in everyday life, and I
            relish brainstorming sessions with friends to solve common pain points of products we use daily.

            visuals with user needs to drive conversion rates.
